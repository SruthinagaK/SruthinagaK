# 🚀 Cybersecurity in Action: My Portfolio & Projects

## 👋 Hi, I'm Naga Sruthi! 
   
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast.Exploring the cyber landscape through hands-on labs and real-world scenarios. Passionate about proactive defense, threat detection, and securing digital environments. Currently working on threat hunting playbooks and vulnerability remediation strategies in cyber range simulations. 

## 🔍 What I'm Working On
- Threat Hunting Projects: Analyzing real-world case studies to detect cyber threats
- Vulnerability Management: Developing strategies for securing systems
## 🎯 Cyber Threat Hunting Engagement 

The Great Admin Heist: Shadows in the System - Simulated Threat Hunting Report – ACME Corp | May 2025

This report [Phantom Hacker Case Study](https://github.com/SruthinagaK/phantom-hackers-case-study) documents a simulated cyber threat hunting exercise involving a fictional breach at ACME Corp by an APT group called The Phantom Hackers. The attackers compromised a privileged IT admin account and deployed a fake antivirus named BitSentinelCore.exe as their initial access vector. Using telemetry from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) and KQL queries, the investigation uncovered 10 key indicators of compromise (flags), mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

🕵️‍♂️ Threat Hunt: Lurker | July2025

🔍 **Summary** :
In the aftermath of a seemingly contained breach, a second machine began showing signs of compromise — but this time, the attacker was more subtle. The logs were cleaner. The traces were faint. And yet, they were there.

This threat hunt report [Luker- Threat Hunting]( https://github.com/SruthinagaK/ThreatHunt-Lurker)  scenario, Lurker, follows a multi-stage investigation across two systems. It uncovers the attacker’s full kill chain nd highlights the importance of timeline analysis and behavioral detection. 

🧭 **Personal Note** :
This is my second time participating in the competition. I was curious to participate and learn from a real-world threat scenario. The experience helped me understand how to analyze the timeline of events and write effective KQL queries.

Whenever I got stuck, I reached out to the community, and the insights and tips I received were incredibly helpful. I’ve learned from my mistakes and improved my approach — and that’s a win in itself.
